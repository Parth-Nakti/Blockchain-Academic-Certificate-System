# Blockchain-Based Academic Certificate System

## 📌 Problem Statement
Traditional academic certificates can be forged or tampered with.
There is no reliable way to verify authenticity digitally.

## 🚀 Proposed Solution
This system uses blockchain principles to store academic certificates securely.
Each certificate is stored in a block with a cryptographic hash.
If any data is altered, the blockchain becomes invalid.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
- Certificate Data → Block
- Block → Hash using SHA-256
- Block linked with Previous Hash
- Blockchain verifies integrity

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)
- SHA-256 Hashing
- Git & GitHub

## 📂 Project Structure
- model → Core classes (Block, Blockchain, Certificate, Student)
- service → Business logic
- ui → User interaction

## 🔐 Features
- Issue certificate
- Generate block hash
- Verify certificate authenticity
- Detect tampering
